# Data for ArDCA Package.

Companion repository of the [ArDCA](https://github.com/pagnani/ArDCA)
package.

This repository contains data for five multiple sequence
alignments (PF00014,PF00072, PF00076,PF00595,PF13354). Data are contained in the
`data` folder:
* alignments are in `fasta.gz` (fasta gzipped format).

*  Reference contact map in the `*_struct.dat` files. The format is plain ASCII
   text. Distance in Angstrom between residue `i,j` (1st and 2nd column
   respectively) is in the 4th column. Residue numbering follows the multiple
   sequence alignment (and not the residue numbering in the unaligned proteins)
